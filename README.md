# My website project

This is my website project. It's a monorepo project that includes frontend wrote
in React and backend in Node.js and Express.js. There is also NoSQL MongoDB
database in the cloud.

#### Main features:

-  Auto generate CV. The data for this feature is the same as the frontend
   _/about.me_ page. I chose **PDF KIT** API to generate PDF from HTML files.
-  Post module to write and share my post on _/jurnal.dev_ page. I used **React
   Markdown** to convert text wrote in Markdown format.
-  Character sequence function to activate admin panel like in old arcane game.
   Just click on _Logo_ and write your secret code.
-  I write admin panel with login and create/edit form for post in my journal.

## Quick start

-  Installation `yarn install`
-  Set .env file for Frontend and Backend
-  Run the server and react app `yarn start`

> I'm used **yarn** because It has simple configuration option for monorepo
> application, when you separate frontend and backend.
